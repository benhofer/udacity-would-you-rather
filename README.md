## About this Project

This is an assigned project for a React Nanodegree on Udacity.com. It is a simple survey app that allows users to create and/or answer survey questions. There is no backend as part of this assignment as per the requirements so the questions and answers are not persisted if the users refresh the page. Also, there are several users precreated to choose from.

## Installing and Setup

To install the project dependencies, run 'npm install'. Then run 'npm start' to start the server.

---

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
